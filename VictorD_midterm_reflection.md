1.I think it went okay. I spent a lot of time trying to just understand the code, and understand how it's supposed to work.
2.I think ymy changes were different from my proposal since I didn't add in a cursor feature and I only added in coins that spawn.
3.I was trying to make the coins spawn as circle graphics but I couldn't get it to work after multiple hours of experimentation, in the end I just gave up and went the route of just using the existing obstacle generator and making square coins.
4.I plan to use past code projects as reference for future haxeflixel projects.
5.Hopefully not waste as much time trying to understand the code.
6.Implement new features.
7.I don't think I had issues with Git version control.
